        ><dfn data-info="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/defaulT.asp"
          >Website!</dfn
        ></a
      >, Give information about something:
      <dfn
        data-info="JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the Web."
        >Javascript</dfn
      >
      and who knows what else!.

      the data info. You can make text as long or short as you want! Example:
